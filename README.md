# Group10_DAMG_Food_Waste_Management
The Food waste Management System has been designed to help reduce food waste in the community. We will be having four roles - supplier, ngo, govt. and logistics. Initially supplier will be logging in. If he has excess food in his restaurant he will be raising food source in supplier table. Once the food source has been raised from supplier directly food will be available in main food table. Once food is available in main food table, NGO will request food from there. Once if they raise food_request from NGO table, it will be directed to logistics table. Logistics will then send the food to NGO. Once NGO receives the food, the food quantity will be changing in the main food table as well has food request will be closed from ngo. Once the food is delivered, Govt will be performing the quality checks based on the food prepared time and they will update quality points and assign back to ngo. Once the quality points are updated, NGO will distributing the food in the community.
